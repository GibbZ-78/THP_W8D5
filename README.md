## THP W8D5 - Manipulating the DOM via Javascript

### :one: Content :scroll:
  
- "exo_parcours_DOM.html" page:  
  - 7 exercises showing access and manipulation of the values / contents of different DOM elements and tree levels  
  - Results are visible solely when showing your browser's debug / developer console (cf. "How to" setion below)  
- "exo_modif_DOM.html" page:  
    - 8 other exercises apprehending DOM elements manipulation (valuation, suppression, displacement...)  
    - It might be needed to reload the HTML page to see the modifications effectively being applied and/or, again, to have a look at your browser's console  
  
### :two: How to :bulb:
  
1. Create an empty directory on your local machine
2. Clone the current Github repository to the latter
3. Open each of the HMTL files using your favorite brower
4. Have (extra super) fun with the proposed approach to solve the different exrcise 
NB: be sure to check your brower's console to see some of the results of the above :eyes:
